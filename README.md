# deepdub
üó£Ô∏è Making videos more accessible to people around the world.

## Welcome
This is the main repo of deepdub. It contains a CLI engine and a [Wooey](https://github.com/wooey/wooey) engine which adds a UI to the CLI. 

## Installation Guide
The CLI and the web server have separate installation mechanisms, however in our tests we find that if you install the CLI first and the web server afterwards, everything comes together pretty nicely.
