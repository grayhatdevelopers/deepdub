# Deepdub Web Server - Installation Guide

There are two kinds of web servers:
- fastapi: This is the version which creates a RESTful API for Deepdub, accessible from Swagger or from the echo app.
- wooey: This simply turns the CLI arguments into an HTML form using Wooey.

Install any which you need.
